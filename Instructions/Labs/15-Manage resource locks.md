# Lab 15 - Manage resource locks

## Lab overview

To protect your Azure resources from accidental deletions or modifications, you can use management locks. These locks allow you to enforce restrictions at different levels: subscription, resource group, or individual resource.

Read-Only Locks: A read-only lock allows read access but prevents any modification to a resource and deletion. Although still allowing authorized users to examine the resource, this kind of lock is important for preventing unintentional modifications to crucial resources.

Delete Locks: Canâ€™t delete the resource but the authorized user can read and modify the resource. This kind of lock is helpful for preventing unintentional or unauthorized deletion of crucial resources.

In this walkthrough,  we will verify the existing resource group, add a lock to the resource group and test deletion, test deleting a resource in the resource group, and remove the resource lock.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Verify the existing resource group
+ Task 2: Add a Lock to the resource group and test deletion
+ Task 3: Test deleting a member of the resource group
+ Task 4: Remove the resource lock

## Estimated timing: 15 minutes

### Task 1: Verify the existing resource group

In this task, we will verify the existing resource group for this exercise. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Resource groups (1)**, and then select **Resource groups (2)** under services.

1. View the existing resource group.

### Task 2:  Add a Lock to the resource group and test deletion

In this task, we will add a resource lock to the resource group and test deleting the resource group. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the existing resource group **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.

1. You can apply a lock to a subscription, resource group, or individual resource to prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources. 

1. In the **Settings** section, click **Locks (1)**, and then click **+ Add (2)**. 

    ![](../images/lab15-image2.png)

1. Configure the new lock. When you are done click **OK (3)**. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Lock name | **RGLock (1)** |
    | Lock Type | **Delete (2)** |
    |||

    ![](../images/lab15-image3.png)

1. On **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> | Locks** blade, from the left navigation select **Overview**.

1. On **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** blade, click on **Delete resource group (1)**. Copy the **Resource Group** name **(2)** and paste it into the **Enter resource group name to confirm deletion (3)** and click **Delete** **(4)** then confirm the deletion by selecting **Delete** on **Delete Confirmtion** window.

   ![](../images/lab15-image4.png)

1. You receive an error message stating the resource group is locked and can't be deleted.

### Task 3: Test deleting a member of the resource group

In this task, we will test if the resource lock protects a storage account in the resource group. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Storage accounts (1)**, and then select **Storage accounts (2)** under services.

    ![](../images/lab15-image6.png)
  
1. On the **Storage accounts** blade, click **+ Create**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information. Leave the defaults for everything else and click on **Review (7)**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **accept the default (1)** |
    | Resource group | **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)** |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (3)** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/> (4)**   |
    | Performance | **Standard (5)** |
    | Replication | **Locally redundant storage (LRS) (6)** |
    |||

     ![](../images/lab15-image(7).png)

1. Once validated, click **Create**. Wait for the notification that the account was successfully created. 

1.  Wait for the notification that the storage account was successfully created and click on **Go to resource**.

     ![](../images/lab15-image8.png)

1. From the **Overview** pane of newly created storage account, click **Delete (1)** and notice **error message** **(2)** stating the resource or its parent has a delete lock. 

    ![](../images/lab15-image9.png)

    **Note**: Although we did not create a lock specifically for the storage account, we did create a lock at the resource group level, which contains the storage account. As such, this *parent* level lock prevents us from deleting the resource and the storage account inherits the lock from the parent.

### Task 4: Remove the resource lock

In this task, we will remove the resource lock and test. 

1. Return to the **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group blade and, in the **Settings** section, click **Locks (1)**. Click the **Delete (2)** link to the right of the **RGLock** entry.

    ![](../images/lab15-image10.png)

1. From the **myRGLocks-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** | locks blade, from the left navigation pane left **Overview** and select **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** storage account.
  
1. On the Storage accounts blade, select **Delect (1)** copy the stoarge account **(2)** name and paste in **Enter storage account name to confirm deletion (3)** field, then click **Delete (4)** and select **Delete** on **Delete Confirmation** windown.

    ![](../images/lab15-image11.png)
  
1. Monitor the notification and confirm you can now delete the resource.

     ![](../images/lab15-image12.png)

   Congratulations! You created a resource group, added a lock to the resource group and tested deletion, tested deleting a resource in the resource group and removed the resource lock. 

1. **Wait for 10 minutes before heading to the Validation Step**
 
<validation step="aeb5bfde-46eb-4f84-8ec7-29cd9438c2cd" />
   
> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
> - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
> - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
