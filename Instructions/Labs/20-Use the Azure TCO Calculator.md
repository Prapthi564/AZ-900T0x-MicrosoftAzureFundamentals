# Lab 20 - Use the Azure TCO Calculator

### Please be aware that no Lab VM is provided for this exercise. You will need to complete the lab on your personal computer.

## Lab Overview

The Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator is a tool provided by Microsoft Azure that helps organizations assess the cost savings and benefits of migrating their workloads to the Azure cloud platform compared to on-premises infrastructure.

In this walkthrough, you will use the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to generate cost comparison report for an on-premises environment.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Configure the TCO calculator
+ Task 2: Review the results and save a copy

## Estimated timing: 10 minutes

**Note**: This walkthrough provides example definitions of on-premises infrastructure and workloads for a typical datacenter. To create a TCO Calculator report, use the example definitions or provide details of your *actual* on-premises infrastructure and workloads.

### Task 1: Configure the TCO calculator

In this task, we will add infrastructure information to the calculator. 

1. Open your preferred browser on your personal machine, navigate to the [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) page.

1. To add details of your on-premises server infrastructure, click **+ Add server workload** in the **Define your workloads** pane.

   >**Note**: You have the freedom to choose the **Currency** option that best suits your needs and proceed with the lab.

1. Click **Next**.

### Task 2: Review the results and save a copy

In this task, we will review cost saving recommendations and download a report. 

1. Review the Azure cost saving recommendations and visualizations.

    | Settings | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Timeframe| **3 years** |
    | Region | **North Europe** |
