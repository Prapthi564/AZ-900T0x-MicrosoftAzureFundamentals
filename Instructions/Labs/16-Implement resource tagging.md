# Lab 16 - Implement resource tagging

## Lab overview

Resource tagging in Azure involves assigning metadata to Azure resources using key-value pairs called tags. These tags can provide additional information about resources, such as environment, department, cost center, owner, or any other relevant attributes. Azure resource tagging offers several benefits, including improved resource management, cost tracking, access control, and automation. 

In this walkthrough, we will create a policy assignment that requires tagging, created a storage account and test the tagging, view resources with a specified tag, and remove the tagging policy.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Policy assignment
+ Task 2: Create a storage account to test the required tagging
+ Task 3: View all resources with a specific tag
+ Task 4: Delete the policy assignment

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create a Policy assignment

In this task, we will configure the **Require a tag on resources** policy and assign it to our subscription. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in Search resources, services and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Policy (1)**, and then select **Policy(2)** under services.

1. In **Authoring (1)** section, click **Assignments (2)**, and then click **Assign Policy (3)** from the top of the page.

   ![](../Labs/images/policy.png)

1. On Basics tab Notice the **Scope (1)** for our policy will be subscription wide. 

1. Select the Policy definition **ellipsis button (2)** (end of the textbox on the right). In **Available definition**, Search/Select **Require a tag and its value on resources** definition, then click **Add**.

1. On the **Assign policy** blade, click **Next**  to switch to **Parameters** tab, type in **Company (1)** for the Tag name and **Contoso (2)** for the Tag Value. Click **Review + create (3)**, and then subsequently click on **Create**.

    >**Note:** This is a simple example to demonstrate tagging. Please note that the assignment takes around 30 minutes to take effect. 
 

1. The **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy assignment is now in place. When a resource is created, it must include a tag with the Company : Contoso key.

### Task 2: Create a storage account to test the required tagging

In this task, we will create storage accounts to test the required tagging. 

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Storage accounts**, and then click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information. Leave the defaults for everything else.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Use your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **AZ-900-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**  |
    | Storage account name | **blobdemo<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    
1. Click **Review + create**. 

    > **Note:** We are testing to see what happens when the tag is not supplied. 

1. You will receive a Validation failed message. On the **Tags** tab note the error message stating that the Require a tag and its value on resources.

1. Provide the tagging information:- 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **Company** (may not be in the drop-down list) |
    | Value| **Contoso** (may not be in the drop-down list) |
    | | |

1. Click **Review + Create** and verify that the validation was successful. Click **Create** to deploy the storage account. 

### Task 3: View all resources with a specific tag

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Tags**.

1. Note all tags and their values. Click the **Company : Contoso** key/value pair. This will display a blade showing the newly created storage account, as long as you included the tag during its deployment.

1. Click **Add filter** and add the **Company** tag key as the filter category. With the filter applied, only your storage account will be listed.

    <validation step="1abed690-3384-4756-82a5-4c5da948616c" />

    >**Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
    > - Navigate to the Lab Validation page from the upper right corner of the lab guide section.
    > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
    > - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
    > - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.

### Task 4: Delete the policy assignment

In this task, we will remove the **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy so it does not affect our future work. 

1. In the portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Policy**.

1. In the **Require a tag and its value on resources** policy entry scroll to the right and click on the elipsis button and selet**Delete Assignment**.

    ![](../images/lb16.2b.png)

1. Confirm you wish to delete the policy assignment in the **Delete assignment** dialogue by clicking **Yes**

1. Now try to create a storage account and the policy will not block the creation.

   >**Note:** It could take a little while for the deleted policy to start working.

In this walkthrough, we created a policy assignment that required tagging, created a storage account and tested the tagging, viewed resources with a specified tag, and removed the tagging policy.

### Review
