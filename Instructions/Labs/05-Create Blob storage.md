# Lab 05 - Create blob storage

## Lab overview

Storage account is a resource that acts as a container that groups all the data services from Azure storage (Azure blobs, Azure files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables). This helps us manage all of them as a group.

In this walkthrough, we will create a storage account, then work with blob storage files.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a storage account
+ Task 2: Work with blob storage
+ Task 3: Monitor the storage account

## Estimated timing: 15 minutes

### Prerequisites

1. In the **Lab-VM**, launch **Notepad** by searching for it in the Start menu, then input a random text within the Notepad application.

1. Next, access the menu bar at the top and select File > Save as. Navigate to the Desktop directory, name the file as **Test**, and save the file to the desktop.

### Task 1: Create a storage account

In this task, we will create a new storage account. 

1. On the Azure portal, from the **Azure services** blade, search for and select **Storage accounts**, and then click **+ Create**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information.Leave the defaults for everything else, then click on **Next**.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Choose the default subscription** |
    | Resource group | **myRGStorage-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>**  |
    | Performance | **Standard** |
    | Redundancy | **Locally redundant storage (LRS)** |

1. On the **Advanced** tab of the **Create a storage account**, choose **Hot** for **Access tier** setting under **Blob storage**.

1. Click **Review + create** to review your storage account settings and allow Azure to validate the configuration. 

1. Once validated, click **Create**. Wait for the **Deployment Succeeded** notification. 

1. From the Home page, search for and select **Storage accounts** and ensure your new storage account is listed.

### Task 2: Work with blob storage

In this task, we will create a Blob container and upload a blob file. 

1. Click on the **storageaccount<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** (newly created storage account), from the left navigation pane under **Data storage** section, and then click **Containers** under Data storage.

1. Click **+ Container** and complete the information. Use the Information icons to learn more. When done click **Create**.

   | Setting | Value |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | Name | **container1**|
   | Anonymous access level| **Private (no anonymous access)** |

1. Click the **container1** container, and then click **Upload**.

1. Browse to a file **Test.txt** that you created in a previous task, located on the desktop, then select the file and select **Open**.
  
1. Click the **Advanced** arrow, leave the default values but review the available options, and then click **Upload**.

    >**Note:** You can upload as many blobs as you like in this way. New blobs will be listed within the container.

1. Once the file is uploaded, right-click on the file and notice the options including View/edit, Download, Properties, and Delete. 

   >**Note:** In the event that the access level for the storage account is configured as public, accessing the contents of the storage account can be done through a URL. To gain a deeper understanding of Storage Account access levels, please go through the following link:[Access Levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure?tabs=portal)

1. As you have time, from the storage account blade, review the options for Files, Tables, and Queues.

### Task 3: Monitor the storage account

1. If needed, return to the storage account blade and click **Diagnose and solve problems**. 

1. Explore some of the most common storage problems. Notice there are multiple troubleshooter.

1. On the storage account blade, scroll down to the **Monitoring** section and click **Insights**. Notice there is information on Failures, Performance, Availability, and Capacity. Your information will be different.
