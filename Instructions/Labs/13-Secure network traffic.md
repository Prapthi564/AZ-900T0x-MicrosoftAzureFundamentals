# Lab 13 - Secure network traffic

## Lab Overview

A Network Security Group (NSG) is a fundamental component of the network security architecture within Microsoft Azure. It acts as a basic, stateful, and centralized firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC), virtual machines (VM), and Azure Virtual Network (VNet) resources.

In this walkthrough, we will configure a network security group.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a virtual machine
+ Task 2: Create a network security group
+ Task 3: Configure an inbound security port rule to allow RDP
+ Task 4: Configure an outbound security port rule to deny Internet access
  
## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine 

In this task, we will create a Windows Server 2019 Datacenter virtual machine. 

1. On the Azure portal, from the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Virtual machines**, and then click **+ Create** then select **Azure Virtual machine**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information (leave the defaults for everything else):

    | Settings | Values |
    |  -- | -- |
    | Subscription | **Accept default subscription**|
    | Resource group | **myRGSecure-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | Virtual machine name | **SimpleWinVM** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>**|
    | Availability option | **No infrastructure redundancy required** |
    | Security type | **Standard** |
    | Image | **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter -x64 Gen 2**|
    | Size | **Standard D2s v3**|
    | Username | **azureuser** |
    | Password | **Pa$$w0rd1234**|
    | Confirm Password | **Pa$$w0rd1234**|
    | Public Inbound ports | **None**|
   
1. Switch to the **Networking** tab, and configure the following setting:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | NIC network security group | **None**|
   
1. Switch to the **Monitoring** tab, and select the following setting:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Boot diagnostics | **Disable**|
   
1. Leave the remaining defaults and then click the **Review + Create** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Once Validation is passed click the **Create** button. It can take about five minutes to deploy the virtual machine.

1. Monitor the deployment. It may take a few minutes for the resource group and virtual machine to be created. 

1. From the deployment blade or from the Notification area, click **Go to resource**. 

1. On the **SimpleWinVM** virtual machine blade, navigate to **Networking**, select **Network Settings**, scroll down, and click on **Add Network Security Group**. Next, click on **Create Port Rule** and select the **Inbound Port Rule** tab from the dropdown menu. Please note that there is currently no network security group associated with the virtual machine's network interface or the subnet linked to it.

    >**Note**: Identify the name of the network interface. You will need it in the next task.

### Task 2: Create a network security group

In this task, we will create a network security group and associate it with the network interface.

1. From the **Search resources, services, and docs** blade, search for and select **Network security groups** and then click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create network security group** blade, replace DeploymentId which is in environment details, specify the following settings.

    | Setting | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Subscription | **Choose your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **myRGSecure-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | Name | **myNSGSecure** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>**  |

1. Click **Review + create** and then after the validation click **Create**.

1. After the NSG is created, click **Go to resource**.

1. Under **Settings** click **Network interfaces** and then **Associate**.

1. Select the **network interface** you identified in the previous task, and then Click **Ok**.

   >**Note**: **If the option is disabled in the dropdown for network interface associations, follow below steps:**

     - Go to the **simplewinvmxxx** network interface, select **Network Security Group (1)** under settings. You will see the currently selected NSG; click on it **(2)**, choose **None (3)** from the dropdown, and Click on **save (4)**.

      - Navigate back to **myNSGSecure** Network security group then under **Settings** click **Network interfaces** and then **Associate**.

      - Select the **network interface** you identified in the previous task, and then Click **Ok**.

### Task 3: Configure an inbound security port rule to allow RDP

In this task, we will allow RDP traffic to the virtual machine by configuring an inbound security port rule. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **SimpleWinVM** virtual machine. 

1. On the **Overview** pane, click **Connect** and then select **Connect**.

1. On **SimpleWinVM** | Connect page, under **Native RDP** click on **Download RDP file**. and click on **Keep** for the warning message pop-up.

    ![](../images/M13T3S3.png)

1. Open the downloaded RDP file.
   
1. Attempt to connect to the virtual machine using RDP. By default, the network security group does not allow RDP. Close the error window. 

    ![Screenshot of the error message that the virtual machine connection has failed.](../images/1201.png)

1. On the virtual machine blade, from the left navigation pane expand **Networking** select **Network settings**, and notice the inbound rules for the **myNSGSecure (attached to network interface: simplewinvm<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"/>)** network security group deny all inbound traffic except traffic within the virtual network and load balancer probes.

1. Click **+ Create port rule** > **Inbound port rule** and provide the below values to the respective settings and  Click **Add**. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Source | **Any**|
    | Source port ranges | **\*** |
    | Destination | **Any** |
    | Destination port ranges | **3389** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Action | **Allow** |
    | Priority | **300** |
    | Name | **AllowRDP** |
  
1. Wait for the rule to be provisioned and then try again to RDP into the virtual machine using the downloaded RDP file. This time you should be successful. Remember the user is **azureuser** and the password is **Pa$$w0rd1234**.

### Task 4: Configure an outbound security port rule to deny Internet access

In this task, we will create an NSG outbound port rule that will deny Internet access and then test to ensure the rule is working.

1. Continue in your virtual machine RDP session. If a pop-up comes then select **yes**.

1. After the machine starts, open an **Internet Explorer** browser, then click on **Ok**. 

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to **https://www.bing.com**. If any Internet Explorer security pop-ups appear, close them and proceed through the IE enhanced security prompts. The page should then be displayed.
   
   > **Note**: We will now configure a rule to deny outbound internet access. 

1. Minimize the RDP session to navigate back to **Azure Portal**.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade of the **SimpleWinVM** virtual machine. 

1. From left navigation pane, expand **Networking** select **Network settings** > then **Outbound port rules**.

1. Notice there is a rule, **AllowInternetOutbound**. This is a default rule and cannot be removed. 

    ![](../images/allowinterntOutbound.png)
   
1. Click on **+ Create port rule** > **Outbound port rule** and configure a new outbound security rule with a higher priority that will deny internet traffic. Click **Add** after configuring the below settings. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | Source | **Any**|
    | Source port ranges | **\*** |
    | Destination | **Service Tag** |
    | Destination service tag | **Internet** |
    | Destination port ranges | **\*** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Action | **Deny** |
    | Priority | **4000** |
    | Name | **DenyInternet** |
   
1. Once the outbound rule is created, verify that the Destination Port Ranges are set to **\***. If the values are modified, change them back to **\*** and click **Save**. **Before clicking the Validate button, ensure that the Destination Port Ranges remain set to **\***, as not doing so will cause the validation to fail**.

1. Return to SimpleWinVM **RDP session**.

1. Browse to **[https://www.bing.com](https://www.bing.com)**. The page should not load. You may need to navigate through additional IE Enhanced Security pop-ups.

1. Kindly refresh the page twice before initiating validation, as it may take a few minutes to take effect.

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** from the desktop inside **SimpleWinVM**.
